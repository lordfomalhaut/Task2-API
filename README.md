This part of the assessment corresponds to Task 2 and was developed based on the database model created in Task 1.

I decided to build a simple API using the data model from Task 1, utilizing FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. The API includes endpoints to retrieve books, students, shelves, and loans, as well as to create and return a loan.


to run the project: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
